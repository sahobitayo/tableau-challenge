## Citi Bike Analytics 
A data visualization project that helps publicize and share information about the New York Citi Bike program from May 2018 to May 2020. Built using Tableau.

### Overview
The New York Citi Bike program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data  webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, there are still unanswered questions as there have yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. To assist with some of the questions, I put together a story board. The story board visualizes and analyses Citi Bike data from May 2018 to May 2020. The purpose of this storyboard is to not only help publicize the data but also to help find ways to improve the bike program in the future. 

Tableau Dashboards
Each section of the story board includes a dashboard with related visualizations:

- Introduction
- Demographics
- Start Station Popularity Dashboard
- End Station Popularity Dashboard
- Most Popular Ride Times Dashboard
- Bikes needed for repairs
- Customers vs Subscribers Dashboard

### About the data
The data used to build the Tableau visualizations comes from the Citi Bike webpage and is available from the webpage as csv files. For more information about the data used to build the visualizations, see https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.

The csv files are stored in a zip file inside the [Resources](https://github.com/sahobitayo/tableau-challenge/tree/master/Resources) folder of this repository.

### Cleaning the data
The steps to clean the data are captured and documented in the [citi_bike_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/sahobitayo/tableau-challenge/blob/master/citi_bike_cleaning.ipynb) jupyter notebook file in this repository.
